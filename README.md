# Moped-Ownership-Project
This was a project through DataCamp to create a ML model to predict whether a moped review came from an owner or not. The data and saved images can be found inside.
As this was for DataCamp purposes originally, everything was done in their workspace, which just makes all of my source code appear in the ipynb found here.
